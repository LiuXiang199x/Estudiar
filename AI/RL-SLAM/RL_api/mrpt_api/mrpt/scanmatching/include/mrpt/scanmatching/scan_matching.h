		/** This method implements a RANSAC-based robust estimation of the rigid transformation between two planar frames of references, returning a probability distribution over all the posibilities as a Sum of Gaussians.
		  *
		  *  The technique was described in the paper:
		  *		- J.L. Blanco, J. González-Jimenez and J.A. Fernandez-Madrigal. "A robust, multi-hypothesis approach to matching occupancy grid maps". Robotica, available on CJO2013. doi:10.1017/S0263574712000732. http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?aid=8815308
		  *
		  * This works are follows:
				- Repeat "ransac_nSimulations" times:
					- Randomly pick TWO correspondences from the set "in_correspondences".
					- Compute the associated rigid transformation.
					- For "ransac_maxSetSize" randomly selected correspondences, test for "consensus" with the current group:
						- If if is compatible (ransac_mahalanobisDistanceThreshold), grow the "consensus set"
						- If not, do not add it.
		  *
		  *  For more details refer to the tutorial on <a href="http://www.mrpt.org/Scan_Matching_Algorithms">scan matching methods</a>.
		  *  NOTE:
		  *        - If a pointer is supplied to "out_largestSubSet", the largest consensus sub-set
		  *          of correspondences will be returned there.
		  *        - The parameter "normalizationStd" is the <b>standard deviation</b> (not variance) of landmarks
		  *          being matched in X,Y. Used to normalize covariances returned as the SoG.
		  *        - If ransac_nSimulations=0 then an adaptive algorithm is used to determine the number of iterations, such as
		  *           a good model is found with a probability p=0.999, or that passed as the parameter probability_find_good_model
		  *        - When using "probability_find_good_model", the minimum number of iterations can be set with "ransac_min_nSimulations".
		  *        - "ransac_maxSetSize" should be set to "in_correspondences.size()" to make sure that every correspondence is tested for each random permutation.
		  *
		  *  If ransac_fuseByCorrsMatch=true (the default), the weight of Gaussian modes will be increased when an exact match in the
		  *   subset of correspondences for the modes is found. Otherwise, an approximate method is used as test by just looking at the
		  *   resulting X,Y,PHI means (Threshold in this case are: ransac_fuseMaxDiffXY, ransac_fuseMaxDiffPhi).
		  *
		  * \param[in] max_rmse_to_end Stop searching for solutions when the RMSE of one solution is below this threshold. Special value "0" means "auto", which employs "2*normalizationStd".
		  *
		  * \exception Raises a std::exception if the list "in_correspondences" has not a minimum of two correspondences.
